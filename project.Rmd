For my analysis I've decided to take the data on alcohol consumption(https://data.world/uncc-dsba/dsba-6100-fall-2016) and the average life expectancy(from the WHO - World Health Organization site (https://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/surveillance/databases/en/)).

So, our null hypothesis $H_0$ is that the alcohol consumption has linear relation with the average life duration (with some specific parameters). Respectively, $H_1$ - that there are no linear dependence.

head(all_life_duration)
```


At first, I calculated the total alcohol consumption in litres. To do that, I've googled the average amount of pure alcohol in all three types of drinks.

```{r}
total_alcohol = as.numeric(alco$beer_servings) * 0.045 + as.numeric(alco$spirit_servings) * 0.4 + as.numeric(alco$wine_servings) * 0.116
```


Selecting year 2013, both sexes, the average life expectancy at birth and the people of any income:

```{r}
life_duration_2013 = as.numeric(subset(all_life_duration, SexCode == "BTSX" & GhoCode == "WHOSIS_000001" & YearCode == 2013 & WorldBankIncomeGroupGroupCode == "")$Numeric)[sample(1:193)]

scatter.smooth(x=total_alcohol, y=life_duration_2013)
```


As we can see, the data hardly has any linear dependence, and also, our linear regression proves it:

```{r}
ln_reg = lm(life_duration_2013~total_alcohol)
summary(ln_reg)
```


The $p$-value is relatively large (0.05 is considered as ok value for good model). Also, the determination coefficient is close to 0, which means the model explains only less than 1 percent of the data (for real-world data, $R^2$ is considered to be good if it takes values near 0.5). The parameters are 71.56989 for the intercept and -0.01480 for the slope.

```{r}
plot(life_duration_2013 ~ total_alcohol, pch = 16, col = "blue")
abline(ln_reg, col = "red") 
```

If we plot the residuals, it also tells us that our model is bad, so we reject $H_0$ that average life duration for both sexes with any income in year 2013 has any linear relation with alcohol consumption :

```{r}
plot(ln_reg$residuals, pch = 16, col = "red")
```


But we do not reject the general hyrothesis, so we'll try to analyse people with similar income: 
Here we also use the data from a different year, because 2013 is not fully filled with the data we need.
The best result I got is:

```{r}
life_duration_2012 = as.numeric(subset(all_life_duration, SexCode == "BTSX" & GhoCode == "WHOSIS_000001" & YearCode == 2012 & WorldBankIncomeGroupGroupCode == "WB_HI")$Numeric)[sample(1:193)]

scatter.smooth(x=total_alcohol, y=life_duration_2012)
```


But, surprisingly, our model turned out to be quite bad, $p$-value is still quite high, also, the determination coefficient is pretty low. 

```{r}
ln_reg = lm(life_duration_2012~total_alcohol)
summary(ln_reg)
```


```{r}
plot(life_duration_2012 ~ total_alcohol, pch = 16, col = "blue") # Plot the results
abline(ln_reg, col = "red") 
```


That happens because of the point, which has the life duration around 55 - the $\textbf{outlier}$. 
Deleting the outlier:

```{r}
my.min <- function(x) ifelse(!all(is.na(x)), min(x, na.rm=T), NA)

index <- which(life_duration_2012 %in% c(my.min(life_duration_2012)))

life_duration_2012 =  life_duration_2012[life_duration_2012!= my.min(life_duration_2012)]

total_alcohol = total_alcohol[total_alcohol != total_alcohol[index]][sample(1:length(life_duration_2012))]
```


```{r}
ln_reg12 = lm(life_duration_2012~total_alcohol)
summary(ln_reg12)
```


```{r}
plot(life_duration_2012~total_alcohol, pch = 16, col = "blue")
abline(ln_reg12, col = "red")
plot(ln_reg12$residuals, pch = 16, col = "red")
```



## Summary
As can be seen, after cleaning the data we got significantly better $p$-value, but the determination coefficient is still very low, so we cannot say that alcohol consuption has any effect on the average life duration in a country.
